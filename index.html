    <h2>Hosted by the UMass Amherst Chess Club</h2>
    
    <div class="content-block details" id="details">
        <h3>Details:</h3>
        <p>The UMass Amherst Chess Club is proud to announce our first USCF rated classical chess tournament! It is a five-round, two-day tournament from April 13-14, hosted in the Student Union Ballroom at 41 Campus Center Way, Amherst, MA 01002. We expect participants from all over and of all ages to compete! Please bring your own sets and chess clocks as we anticipate a shortage. Unrated players are eligible for entry. Note: the prizes below are based on 170 players, and a valid USCF membership is required to play.</p>
        <p>Food: Within a 5 minute walk from the Student Union Ballroom, we have Harvest Market and Worcester Dining Commons with plenty of options. We've been ranked #1 in Dining across the US, so give our food a try — it’s definitely worth it! There are also several hydration stations just outside the playing hall.</p>
